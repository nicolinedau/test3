        <h4>WHO AM I?</h4>
        <article class="box2">
          My name is Nicoline Juul Dau, and I am a 21 year old student who study's multimediadesign.
               I have a passion for fashion and the whole industry about it.
               Besides that, I have always been creative and have been drawing my whole life.
               I love how some lines on a paper, a computer or whatever, can become an entire expression in the end.
               But to come back to the fashion part - I also really love the graphic design.
               The whole graphic design part in a magazine has such a big meaning when it comes to the expression.

    <h1>WHAT CAN I OFFER?</h1>
    <article class="box3">
      I can offer an eye for the detail. I live for the details.
I believe it is the colors, the fonts, the pictures - the little things, that shows who you are as person,
and they are all the small pieces in a puzzle of expression.
Since I have the passion for fashion and the graphic design, I can vouch for everything that I make,
and I can promise you that it is made with passion, eye for the detail,
and something that will make you pee in your pants of happiness.
